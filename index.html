              Many times these practices are unknown by users. As a future cybersecurity analyst, I am concerned about the ignorance about our privacy. In this website you will learn:

            <p>
              As you have see in the previous part i know a lot of information about you, just only becouse you have browse to my web.

              If I have not succeeded with any, it is because you are already protected, congratulations! But i am pretty sure that you are not safe from this one. <br><br>

              This exploit was my own idea, webs are allow to save themselves as a history entry, but what if they could impersonate others?.

              I'm going to propose 2 ideas of what could be done with this. You can click in the second one to see the demo (I could do it without you clicking, but I don't want to poison your history without your consent).
            </p>

            </div>

              <div class="icon"><a href="javascript:makeHistoryInyection();"><i class="bi bi-bug"></i></a></div>
              <h4 class="title"><a href="javascript:makeHistoryInyection();">Web spoofing</a></h4>
              <p class="description">The last entrance of your history will seems to be the famous Bank of America, but instead it will be my website 
                (Imagine for a second what it would mean to enter a website that "looks like your trusted bank" but is not. Does this sound familiar to you? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">spoofing atack</a>).</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Here you can see how this exploit works.
              <ul>
                <li>First the web changes the following data:
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Favicon</b>, for one of the web to impersonate</li>
                    <li><b>Title</b>, for the title of the desire web to impersonate</li>
                    <li><b>Url</b>, adding a param called redirect, with this the web will know where to send the petition</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Then the web adds itself to the history register.</li>
                <li>And then, in order not to be suspicions, it redirects to itself.</li>
              </ul>
              After that when the user opens the history he will see our web, and also his usual bank page (but is not). If he decides to access his banking website from the history (a totally normal operation), in reality he will be going to our website, where we have control over where to send it, like to a website where to steal his banking credentials, but in this case don't worry, I'll send you to the best Linkedin profile.
            </p>

              <br>How can you prevent this atack?, It's very simple just disable history or use private tabs.

            <p>
              Nowadays VPNs are one of the most widely used products. They promise to hide your identity. That's true, if you're using a VPN right now, my website won't be able to tell who you are. But your VPN provider can do it.

              Always keep in mind that if a product is free it is because you are the product. If you are using a free VPN, think now why a guy would pay for a server network to protect you. The answer is pretty easy, becouse he is selling all your data. <br><br>

              To understand this, it is important to know that a VPN is nothing more than an intermediary, requesting services for you on your behalf. Yes, the service does not know that you are the one who requested it, but your VPN provider knows everything you have requested, when and if you are not careful, even why. <br><br>

              After reading this you will be thinking so VPNs are not secure! I am not saying that, as a good cybersecurity teacher told me one day, antivirus and vpns are not products, they are services. And as said Kevin Mitnick at the end of the chain you will have to trust in some provider. The last and one of the most important principes of cibersecurity is that total security does not exists. <br><br>

              So if you are using a paid VPN and from a reputable provider, you should be safe. If not, be aware of the info you are using, (credentials, credit cards...) <br><br>

              So are proxys safer? NOT at all. Public proxies are not encrypting your connection to them, you are hiding your request to the web, but not your connection to the proxy. Also, proxies are the preferred form of malware injection, so avoid them. Unless you create your own, you are more likely to be in danger using them than to be safe. <br><br>

              To sum up, if you want to hide your data, you must use a VPN, but from a reputable provider. This will come at a cost, but that is completely normal and you will have to deal with it, at the end of the day, the software engineers have to eat. <br><br>

              And remember you are the best antivirus! Be safe!
